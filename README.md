Project Title: Diwali Sales Analysis with Python

Project Overview:
In this individual Python data analysis project, a Diwali Sales dataset was explored to extract valuable insights that could help a company boost sales and revenue during the festive season. The dataset, consisting of 11,251 rows and 15 columns, was analyzed to uncover various aspects of customer demographics, preferences, and purchase behaviors.

Key Observations:

Gender Distribution: The dataset revealed a skew towards females, with more than double the count of male customers. Moreover, females exhibited significantly higher purchasing power compared to males.

Age Group Insights: The age group 26-35 emerged as the most active segment of buyers, with females significantly outnumbering their male counterparts.

Regional Analysis: In terms of the number of orders, Uttar Pradesh took the lead, with Maharashtra and Karnataka following closely in second and third place.

Marital Status: Single (unmarried) customers outnumbered married ones in the dataset, with married women being a prominent customer segment.

Occupation Trends: The majority of customers were employed in the IT sector, indicating a specific target audience.

Product Category Preferences: The data revealed that most orders fell into the categories of Clothing & Apparel, Food products, and Electronics. These categories were particularly popular among customers.

Top-Selling Products: Products with IDs P00265242 and P00110942 were the best-sellers, attracting the most orders.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, this analysis uncovered valuable insights into the customer base for the Diwali Sales dataset. Targeting married women between the ages of 26-35, primarily from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, especially those employed in the IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sectors, could significantly enhance sales in the Food, Clothing & Apparel, and Electronics product categories. This project provided a data-driven approach to make informed decisions and drive revenue growth during the Diwali sales season.
